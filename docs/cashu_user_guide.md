# Cashu Feature User Guide

## Overview

The Cashu feature enables you to manage Bitcoin through simple WhatsApp messages. You can check your balance, pay Lightning invoices, create payment requests, and send Bitcoin to others using natural language commands. No app installation required - everything works through WhatsApp!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **WhatsApp Account**: You need an active WhatsApp account
2. **Beacon Registration**: You must be registered with the Beacon system
3. **Internet Connection**: Required for Bitcoin operations

### First Time Setup

When you first use a Bitcoin command, the system automatically creates a Cashu wallet for you. No additional setup required!

**Example First Message**:

```
check my bitcoin balance
```

**System Response**:

```
üí∞ Your wallet balance is 0 sats

Your Cashu wallet has been created and is ready to use!
```

## Available Commands

### 1. Check Balance

Check how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet.

**Command Examples**:

üí∞ Your wallet balance is 5,000 sats
```

**Response Example**:

## Error Messages and Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

#### Service Unavailable

```
‚ùå I'm sorry, Cashu services are currently down. Please try again later.
```

**Solution**: Wait a few minutes and try again. If the problem persists, contact support.

#### Invalid Invoice

```
‚ùå That doesn't look like a valid Lightning invoice. Lightning invoices start with 'lnbc'.
```

**Solution**: Check that you copied the complete invoice string starting with "lnbc".

#### Insufficient Balance

```
‚ùå Insufficient balance. You have 500 sats, but need 1,000 sats.
```

**Solution**: Add more funds to your wallet or reduce the amount.

#### Request Timeout

```
‚ùå The request timed out. Please try again.
```

**Solution**: Try the command again. If it continues to fail, there may be network issues.

#### Unclear Request

```
I understand you want to do something with Bitcoin/Cashu, but I'm not sure what exactly. You can:

‚Ä¢ Check balance: 'check my balance'
‚Ä¢ Pay invoice: 'pay [invoice]'
‚Ä¢ Create invoice: 'create invoice for [amount] sats'
‚Ä¢ Send tokens: 'send [amount] sats to [recipient]'
```

**Solution**: Use one of the suggested command formats.

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Use clear commands like "check my balance" rather than just "bitcoin"
2. **Include Units**: Always specify "sats" or "satoshis" for amounts
3. **Complete Invoices**: Copy the entire Lightning invoice string
4. **Wait for Responses**: Allow time for operations to complete
5. **Check Spelling**: Ensure recipient names are spelled correctly
