> On the island of Pharos the Ptolemies lit a beacon that turned Alexandria into the nerve-centre of the ancient world, guiding mariners safely into the port of liberty, knowledge and freedom.
>
> The goal of the project is to relight that flame on the internet, building a trojan horse inside the most ubiquitous chat networks in the world to guide people towards free information, free networks and freedom money. 
>
> Wherever a handset can send a text, The Beacon can deliver knowledge, coordination, and untraceable Satoshis.
>
> The tower is gone; but the light will remain.

Beacon is intended to be an open protocol to allow comunities to offer access to freedom tech, with no on device install and minimal barrier to entry sign up in applicaitons people already use. 

A trojan horse for freedom tech. 

## Beacon App 

Is the open source code behind a reference implementation for beacon. It will provide both WhatsApp and Signal gateways to access your Nostr based Beacon account. 

- Beacon-App: defines the agent framework to manage your requests and deliver specific user flows for different pre-defined experiences inside the app. 
- Beacon-signer: is a remote signing server which can either be self hosted on a laptop and provides signing of Beacon activities cordinated via NostrMQ and gateways. 

### Purpose 

The purpose of beacon is not to be "the wallet to end them all" it is to provide a pragmatic entry point to freedom tech. 

It was born out of an initial frustration of trying to deliver sophisticated apps in places where the regular user couldn't afford internet, the internet was bad when they did have it, smartphones bearly existed and the only single thing that ever worked reliably was whatsapp. 

Turns out Zuckerberg already pays for subsidised access to a limited, controlled pastiche of the internet. 

But in the world of AI the humble text box is more or less all you need to orchectrate any functionality you could desire. 

So lets meet the people where they are, give them access to the all the information and services on the internet and make freedom tech accessible to all.
