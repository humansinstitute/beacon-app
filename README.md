> On the island of Pharos the Ptolemies lit a beacon that turned Alexandria into the nerve-centre of the ancient world, guiding mariners safely into the port of liberty, knowledge and freedom.
> The goal of the project is to relight that flame in cyberspace, building a trojan horse inside the most ubiquitous chat networks in the world to guide people towards free information, freedom networks and freedom money. 
> Wherever a handset can send a text, The Beacon can deliver knowledge, coordination, and untraceable Satoshis.
> The tower is gone; but the light will remain.
