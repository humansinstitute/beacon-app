> On the island of Pharos the Ptolemies lit a beacon that turned Alexandria into the nerve-centre of the ancient world, guiding mariners safely into the port of liberty, knowledge and freedom.
>
> The goal of the project is to relight that flame in cyberspace, building a trojan horse inside the most ubiquitous chat networks in the world to guide people towards free information, freedom networks and freedom money. 
>
> Wherever a handset can send a text, The Beacon can deliver knowledge, coordination, and untraceable Satoshis.
>
> The tower is gone; but the light will remain.

Beacon is intended to be an open protocol to allow comunities to offer access to freedom tech, with no on device install and minimal barrier to entry sign up in applicaitons people already use. 

A trojan horse for freedom tech.
